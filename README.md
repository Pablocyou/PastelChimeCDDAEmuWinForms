# PastelChimeCDDAEmuWinForms

Runs on Windows, uses a special patched version of Pastel Chime to display the current CD Track on the game's title window.
Periodically polls xSystem35's Window Title to check the CD Track and play it.
Can be run before of after running Pastel Chime.

Should work on Linux too though I have not tested it.
